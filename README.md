# MultiplEYE preprocessing

## Quick start
Assuming you have set up an environment with the required dependencies (see pyproject.toml), you can run the preprocessing.

1. Update the relevant information in `multipleye_settings_preprocessing.yaml`
2. Ideally you used uv to set up your environment, so you can directly run:
```bash
run_multipleye_preprocessing
```
