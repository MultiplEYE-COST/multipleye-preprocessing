    abstract = {Eye-tracking-while-reading data provide valuable insights across multiple disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, natural language processing, education, and human-computer interaction. Despite its potential, the availability of large, high-quality, multilingual datasets remains limited, hindering both foundational reading research and advancements in applications. The MultiplEYE project addresses this gap by establishing a large-scale, international eye-tracking data collection initiative. It aims to create a multilingual dataset of eye movements recorded during natural reading, balancing linguistic diversity, while ensuring methodological consistency for reliable cross-linguistic comparisons. The dataset spans numerous languages and follows strict procedural, documentation, and data pre-processing standards to enhance eye-tracking data transparency and reproducibility. A novel data-sharing framework, integrated with data quality reports, allows for selective data filtering based on research needs. Researchers and labs worldwide are invited to join the initiative. By establishing and promoting standardized practices and open data sharing, MultiplEYE facilitates interdisciplinary research and advances reading research and gaze-augmented applications.},

    abstract = {Eye movement research is often obstructed by the time-consuming challenges of accessing and preprocessing datasets, diverting efforts from scientific discovery. Researchers often struggle with non-standardized data formats, incomplete metadata, and scattered dataset repositories. Moreover, visibility of tediously collected and curated datasets is hindered without central aggregators that reference these valuable works. pymovements addresses these shortcomings by providing researchers with a seamless way to announce, discover, download, and process published eye movement datasets. We encourage researchers to contribute their eye-tracking datasets to our library to increase their visibility and impact.},

    abstract = {We present a battery of four working memory tasks that are implemented using MATLAB and the free Psychophysics Toolbox. The package includes preprocessing scripts in R and SPSS to facilitate data analysis. The four tasks consist of a sentence-span task, an operation-span task, a spatial short-term memory test, and a memory updating task. These tasks were chosen in order to provide a heterogeneous set of measures of working memory capacity, thus reducing method variance and tapping into two content domains of working memory (verbal, including numerical, vs. spatial) and two of its functional aspects (storage in the context of processing and relational integration). The task battery was validated in three experiments conducted in two languages (English and Chinese), involving more than 350 participants. In all cases, the tasks were found to load on a single latent variable. In a further experiment, the latent working memory variable was found to correlate highly but not perfectly with performance on Raven's matrices test of fluid intelligence. We suggest that the battery constitutes a versatile tool to assess working memory capacity with either English- or Chinese-speaking participants. The battery can be downloaded from www.cogsciwa.com (``Software'' button).},

    abstract = {Conducting experiments with diverse participants in their native languages can uncover insights into culture, cognition, and language that may not be revealed otherwise. However, conducting these experiments online makes it difficult to validate self-reported language proficiency. Furthermore, existing proficiency tests are small and cover only a few languages. We present an automated pipeline to generate vocabulary tests using text from Wikipedia. Our pipeline samples rare nouns and creates pseudowords with the same low-level statistics. Six behavioral experiments (N=236) in six countries and eight languages show that (a) our test can distinguish between native speakers of closely related languages, (b) the test is reliable (\$r=0.82\$), and (c) performance strongly correlates with existing tests (LexTale) and self-reports. We further show that test accuracy is negatively correlated with the linguistic distance between the tested and the native language. Our test, available in eight languages, can easily be extended to other languages.},
