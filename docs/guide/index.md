# Reference Guide

This guide will walk you through the details of how to use the preprocessing pipeline.
First, the {ref}`configuration_guide` section will explain the settings that need to be
configured before running the pipeline.
The {ref}`preprocessing_guide` section includes the most central and computationally expensive steps
of the pipeline.
Here, the eye-tracking data will be processed.
Additionally, the {ref}`psychometric_tests` section describes how to process
the psychometric tests. This step is rather fast.
