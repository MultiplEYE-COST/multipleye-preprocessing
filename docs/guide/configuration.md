# Configuration

The configuration of the preprocessing pipeline is handled by the `config.py` and `constants.py`
files.
You can find these files in the `preprocessing/` directory.
As the names suggest, ... we suggest the settings in `constants.py` to be kept as default values,
unless you know what you are doing.
Edits must be made manually. While some calculations can be passed explicit variables,
it is best just to set the values once centrally, so throughout the pipeline no values need to be
passed.

[//]: # (TODO: explain the values from the config.py here, the constants do not get an explanation here)
